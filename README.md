# Small-Village-Computer-Graphics-Project
This computer graphics project is a visualization of a landscape that includes various shapes and animations. The project is written in C++ and uses OpenGL for rendering graphics.

# Prerequisites
  To run this project, you need to have an OpenGL environment set up on your computer. You can download and install OpenGL from the official website: https://www.opengl.org/

# How to use
  To use this project, you need to do the following steps:
  Clone the project repository from the GitHub link provided.
  Compile the project by running the makefile.
  Run the executable file.
  The program will display the landscape with the various shapes and animations.

# File Structure
The project consists of the following files:

  main.cpp: This is the main C++ file that contains the code for rendering the landscape and the shapes.
  shapes.h: This header file contains the code for creating the shapes used in the project, including triangle, quad, circle, polygon, and GL-line.
  animations.h: This header file contains the code for creating the animations used in the project, including rotation and movement.
  makefile: This file contains the compilation instructions for the project.

# Code Explanation

  The main.cpp file is the core of the project, which includes rendering the landscape, shapes, and animations. The code is structured in a modular way, with each shape and animation being created as a separate function that can be called and placed in the landscape.
  The shapes.h file contains the code for creating the shapes used in the project. The shapes are created using OpenGL primitives and can be modified by changing the parameters of the functions.
  The animations.h file contains the code for creating the animations used in the project. The animations are created using mathematical calculations and can be modified by changing the parameters of the functions.

# Conclusion
  This computer graphics project is a visualization of a landscape that includes various shapes and animations. The project is written in C++ and uses OpenGL for rendering graphics. The code is structured in a modular way, making it easy to modify and add new shapes and animations.
